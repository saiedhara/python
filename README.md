basics of python

1. Error handling in python:-  In Python, exceptions can be handled using a try statement. 
                               The critical operation which can raise an exception is placed inside the try clause.
                               The code that handles the exceptions is written in the except clause. 
                               We can thus choose what operations to perform once we have caught the exception.
